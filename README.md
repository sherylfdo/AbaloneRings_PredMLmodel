# AbaloneRings_PredMLmodel
**Problem Statement:**
There is a large amount of data available about abalone and its features. But there has been little analysis and visualization done to understand features of the abalone to find its rings(ages). 
This research focuses on how to analyze and how the other features of abalone effects on the rings. 
This dataset can be visualize using leveraged Power BI framework to filter the data in a simple and digestible format which can assist to formulate conclusions on the effects that these features 
may have on the rings(ages). After visualizing the data via Power BI, the framework obtains logistic regressions to determine the relationships. 
The results indicate that the Power BI framework can effectively and innovatively provide analysis on the abalone features. 
Through the reformulated data for an individual abalone, we can analyze and predict the rings of an abalone.

**ABALONE:**
Abalone are shellfish, a genus of gastropods. 
The meat (foot muscle) of abalone is used for food, and the shells of abalone are used as decorative items and as a source of mother of pearl for jewelry, buttons, buckles, and inlay.

A prediction model is built to predict the number of rings of an abalone shell based on it's other features. 
The data has been visualized using Power BI and Jupyter Notebook tools.
